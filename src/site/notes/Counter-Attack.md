# Counter-Attack

## Definition and Strategic Framework

Counter-attack represents the sophisticated transformation of defensive positions into offensive operations, utilizing opponent's aggressive commitments to create superior attacking chances. This advanced strategic concept transcends simple counter-threats, involving systematic exploitation of positional imbalances, tactical vulnerabilities, and strategic overextension created by opponent's attacking play.

Distinguished from reactive defense, counter-attack requires strategic foresight, accurate timing, and precise calculation to convert defensive responsibilities into winning initiatives while maintaining positional soundness and tactical safety.
