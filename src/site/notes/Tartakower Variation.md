The Tartakower Variation represents one of the most sophisticated and strategically rich systems within the Queen's Gambit Declined, characterized by Black's early ...b6 and subsequent ...Bb7 development. This hypermodern approach combines the solid Orthodox structure with active piece development and long-term strategic counterplay.

Named after the Polish-French grandmaster Savielly Tartakower, this system gained prominence in the mid-20th century and remains a popular choice for players seeking dynamic play within classical positional frameworks.

## Historical Development and Theoretical Evolution

### Early Development (1920s-1940s)

**Savielly Tartakower** pioneered this approach as part of the hypermodern revolution, demonstrating that Black could achieve active piece development while maintaining structural solidity. The system represented a departure from purely passive defensive concepts.

**Strategic Innovation:**

- **Active Bishop Development:** Placing the light-squared bishop on the long diagonal
- **Hypermodern Concepts:** Central pressure through piece placement rather than pawn occupation
- **Dynamic Balance:** Combining solid structure with active piece play
- **Practical Chances:** Creating imbalanced positions with mutual opportunities

### Classical Period Refinement (1950s-1970s)

World championship practice validated the system's theoretical soundness while revealing key strategic themes and typical middle game plans. Leading practitioners developed sophisticated understanding of the variation's strategic potential.

**Theoretical Contributors:**

- **Vasily Smyslov:** Refined strategic understanding and technical execution
- **Tigran Petrosian:** Advanced positional concepts and defensive techniques
- **Anatoly Karpov:** Modern systematic approach and preparation methods

### Contemporary Practice (1980s-Present)

Computer analysis and database research have confirmed the variation's objective soundness while revealing subtle improvements and alternative approaches within the established theoretical framework.
