The Queen's Indian Defense represents one of Black's most solid and flexible responses to 1.d4, characterized by the fianchetto of the light-squared bishop to b7 and a focus on controlling the e4 square. This hypermodern approach delays direct central occupation in favor of piece development and strategic pressure, offering Black a reliable system with rich positional content.

Named for its popularity among Indian players in the early 20th century and its relationship to the Queen's Gambit, the Queen's Indian Defense embodies sophisticated positional understanding while maintaining dynamic potential suitable for players seeking solid yet ambitious play.
