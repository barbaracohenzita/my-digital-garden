# Defensive Strategy

## Definition and Fundamental Principles

Defensive strategy encompasses the systematic methods, principles, and techniques employed to maintain position stability, neutralize opponent threats, and create counterplay opportunities when facing superior force or initiative. Distinguished from purely reactive play, effective defense combines accurate calculation, strategic foresight, and tactical vigilance to transform difficult positions into balanced or even advantageous outcomes.

Modern defensive understanding emphasizes active resistance over passive endurance, utilizing precise technique and strategic planning to convert defensive responsibilities into offensive opportunities.
