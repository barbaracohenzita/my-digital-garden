# Basic Rules
## Overview

Chess is a strategic board game played between two players on an 8×8 grid with alternating light and dark squares. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.

---

## The Chessboard

### Board Setup

- **8×8 grid** with 64 alternating light and dark squares
- **Files** (columns) labeled a-h from left to right
- **Ranks** (rows) numbered 1-8 from bottom to top for White
- **Light square** always positioned in the bottom-right corner for each player
- **Queen placement:** White queen on d1 (light square), Black queen on d8 (dark square)

### Coordinate System

Each square is identified by its file letter and rank number:

- **a1** = bottom-left corner (White's perspective)
- **h8** = top-right corner (White's perspective)
- **Center squares:** d4, d5, e4, e5

---

## Piece Values and Initial Setup

### Material Values (Relative)

- **Pawn:** 1 point
- **Knight:** 3 points
- **Bishop:** 3 points
- **Rook:** 5 points
- **Queen:** 9 points
- **King:** Invaluable (game ends if captured)

### Starting Position

**White pieces (1st and 2nd ranks):**

- 1st rank: Ra1, Nb1, Bc1, Qd1, Ke1, Bf1, Ng1, Rh1
- 2nd rank: Pawns on a2-h2

**Black pieces (7th and 8th ranks):**

- 8th rank: Ra8, Nb8, Bc8, Qd8, Ke8, Bf8, Ng8, Rh8
- 7th rank: Pawns on a7-h7

---

## Piece Movement

### Pawn Movement

**Standard Movement:**

- Moves forward one square to an unoccupied square
- From starting position, may advance two squares
- Cannot move backward

**Capturing:**

- Captures diagonally forward one square
- Cannot capture pieces directly in front

**Special Rules:**

- [[En Passant\|En Passant]] - Special pawn capture rule
- [[Pawn Promotion\|Pawn Promotion]] - Transformation upon reaching opposite end

### Rook Movement

**Movement Pattern:**

- Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically
- Cannot jump over other pieces
- Path must be clear to destination square

**Characteristics:**

- Controls ranks and files
- Powerful in open positions
- Essential for [[Castling\|Castling]]

### Bishop Movement

**Movement Pattern:**

- Moves any number of squares diagonally
- Cannot jump over other pieces
- Confined to squares of one color throughout the game

**Characteristics:**

- Light-squared bishop controls light squares only
- Dark-squared bishop controls dark squares only
- Long-range pieces effective in open positions

### Knight Movement

**Movement Pattern:**

- Moves in "L" shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular
- Only piece that can jump over other pieces
- Always lands on square of opposite color from starting square

**Possible moves from central square:**

- Two squares up/down, one square left/right
- Two squares left/right, one square up/down
- Maximum of 8 possible moves from center
- Minimum of 2 possible moves from corner

### Queen Movement

**Movement Pattern:**

- Combines rook and bishop movement
- Moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- Cannot jump over other pieces
- Most powerful piece in terms of mobility

**Characteristics:**

- Controls maximum number of squares
- Vulnerable to attacks due to high value
- Typically developed later in the game

### King Movement

**Movement Pattern:**

- Moves one square in any direction: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
- Cannot move into check
- Cannot move to squares attacked by enemy pieces

**Special Rules:**

- [[Castling\|Castling]] - Special move involving king and rook
- Cannot be captured (game ends in checkmate)
- Must escape check immediately

---

## Special Moves

### Castling

**Requirements:**

- King and chosen rook have not moved
- No pieces between king and rook
- King not in check
- King does not move through or into check

**Kingside Castling (O-O):**

- King moves two squares toward h-file rook
- Rook moves to square between king's original and final position

**Queenside Castling (O-O-O):**

- King moves two squares toward a-file rook
- Rook moves to square between king's original and final position

### En Passant

**Conditions:**

- Opponent's pawn moves two squares from starting position
- Your pawn is on same rank, adjacent file
- Capture must be made immediately on next move

**Execution:**

- Move your pawn diagonally to square behind opponent's pawn
- Remove opponent's pawn from board

### Pawn Promotion

**Conditions:**

- Pawn reaches opposite end of board (8th rank for White, 1st rank for Black)

**Options:**

- Promote to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight
- Queen promotion most common
- [[Underpromotion\|Underpromotion]] to other pieces occasionally advantageous

---

## Game Mechanics

### Turn Structure

- White moves first
- Players alternate moves
- Only one piece moved per turn (except castling)
- Move cannot be taken back once piece is released

### Capturing

- Piece moves to square occupied by enemy piece
- Captured piece removed from board
- Cannot capture own pieces
- King cannot be captured (must be given check)

### Check

**Definition:** King under attack by enemy piece

**Requirements:**

- Player in check must immediately respond
- Cannot make moves that leave king in check
- Must escape check by: moving king, blocking attack, or capturing attacking piece

### Checkmate

**Definition:** King in check with no legal moves available

**Game Termination:**

- Player whose king is checkmated loses
- No further moves possible
- Game ends immediately

### Stalemate

**Definition:** Player to move has no legal moves but king not in check

**Result:** Game declared a draw

---

## Draw Conditions

### Automatic Draws

- **Stalemate:** No legal moves, king not in check
- **Insufficient Material:** Neither side can force checkmate
- **Threefold Repetition:** Same position occurs three times
- **Fifty-Move Rule:** Fifty moves without pawn move or capture

### Agreed Draws

- **Mutual Agreement:** Both players agree to draw
- **Perpetual Check:** Continuous checking with no escape

---

## Basic Tactical Concepts

### Fundamental Attacks

- **Check:** Attack on the king
- **Pin:** Piece cannot move without exposing more valuable piece
- **Fork:** Single piece attacks two enemy pieces simultaneously
- **Skewer:** Valuable piece forced to move, exposing less valuable piece

### Defensive Concepts

- **Blocking:** Interposing piece between attacker and target
- **Capturing:** Removing attacking piece
- **Moving:** Relocating attacked piece to safety

---

## Notation

### Algebraic Notation

**Piece Symbols:**

- K = King, Q = Queen, R = Rook, B = Bishop, N = Knight
- Pawns designated by destination square only

**Basic Notation:**

- **Simple move:** e4 (pawn to e4), Nf3 (knight to f3)
- **Capture:** exd5 (pawn captures on d5), Nxe5 (knight captures on e5)
- **Check:** + (Qh5+)
- **Checkmate:** # (Qh7#)
- **Castling:** O-O (kingside), O-O-O (queenside)

### Reading Moves

- Destination square always specified
- Piece type specified (except pawns)
- Captures indicated with "x"
- Check and checkmate indicated with + and #

---

## Essential Principles

### Opening Principles

- Control the center (e4, e5, d4, d5)
- Develop pieces toward center
- Ensure king safety early
- Avoid moving same piece twice
- Castle early

### General Principles

- Protect valuable pieces
- Look for opponent's threats before moving
- Consider all possible moves
- Calculate consequences before moving
- Maintain piece coordination

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Movement Errors

- Moving pieces incorrectly (knight not in L-shape)
- Moving into check
- Forgetting special rules (en passant, castling requirements)

### Strategic Errors

- Bringing queen out too early
- Neglecting king safety
- Not developing pieces
- Moving same piece repeatedly
- Ignoring opponent's threats

### Rule Violations

- Castling illegally
- Not responding to check
- Moving pieces through other pieces (except knight)

---

## Practice Recommendations

### Movement Mastery

- Practice piece movement patterns
- Solve basic puzzles involving piece movement
- Play slow games focusing on legal moves
- Study basic tactical patterns

### Rule Application

- Practice special moves (castling, en passant)
- Learn notation through game recording
- Understand check and checkmate patterns
- Practice identifying illegal moves
