The Cambridge Springs Defense represents one of the most dynamic and tactically sophisticated variations within the Queen's Gambit Declined, characterized by Black's bold early queen development to a5, creating immediate tactical pressure on White's position. This system combines solid positional foundations with sharp tactical complications, offering Black excellent practical chances through active piece play.

Named after the Cambridge Springs chess tournament of 1904, where this defense was prominently featured, the variation exemplifies the principle of active defense through immediate counter-threats rather than passive resistance.
