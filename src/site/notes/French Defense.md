The French Defense represents one of chess's most solid and strategically rich defensive systems, characterized by Black's early ...e6 move supporting a subsequent ...d5 central challenge. This classical approach prioritizes structural solidity and strategic complexity over immediate tactical complications, creating positions rich in long-term planning and positional maneuvering.

Named after its adoption by French players in a correspondence match between London and Paris in 1834, the French Defense has evolved into a sophisticated defensive system employed at all levels of competitive chess, from club tournaments to world championships.
