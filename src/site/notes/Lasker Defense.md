The Lasker Defense represents one of the most active and strategically sophisticated approaches within the Queen's Gambit Declined, characterized by Black's bold central knight advance to e4. This system embodies dynamic piece play and tactical complexity while maintaining the solid structural foundation of the Orthodox Defense.

Named after Emanuel Lasker, the second World Champion who pioneered and popularized this approach, the defense exemplifies the principle of active piece development over passive positional consolidation.
